# MLOps Zoomcamp Project 2025 ‚Äì Sleep Stress Prediction üßò

## üìå 1. Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, sleep is often neglected despite its crucial role in physical and mental well-being. Chronic stress‚Äîoften exacerbated by poor sleep quality‚Äîhas become a major health concern. This project explores the relationship between various physiological indicators during sleep and stress levels the following day.

Using the [SaYoPillow dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laavanya/human-stress-detection-in-and-through-sleep/data), which simulates sensor data collected by a smart yoga pillow system, we train a machine learning model to predict next-day stress levels based on sleep-related physiological parameters. This solution supports the development of "smart sleeping" technologies and contributes to the broader vision of AI-assisted wellness.


## üìÇ 2. Dataset Description
